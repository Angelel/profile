              <p>" After an International Business Master in France and a year at Accenture, I have decided to pursue my natural interest in technology by following an intensive coding bootcamp for two months. <strong>I am now looking for a product manager position where I could use and develop the skills I have acquired in these multiple experiences.</strong>"</p>
